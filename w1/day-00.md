# Day 0 â€” From Fire Signals to Analog Telephony

## Objectives
- Trace the evolution of communications from ancient signaling to analog telephony
- Understand how physics and engineering constraints shaped early telephone systems
- Learn the core analog concepts that lead into digital telephony (Day 2)

## Why Day 0?
Before PBXs and SIP, people still needed to communicate at a distance. Knowing how we got to analog telephony gives you the intuition for why telephony systems look the way they do today.

## A Fast Timeline
- Prehistory â†’ 19th c.: Beacons, drums, optical semaphores, electric telegraph (Morse, 1830s)
- 1876: Bellâ€™s telephone patXent â€” transmit voice as a varying electrical signal
- 1880sâ€“1900s: Manual switchboards, local loops, magneto telephones
- 1910sâ€“1930s: Common-battery systems, loaded lines, vacuum-tube amplifiers
- 1930sâ€“1960s: Carrier telephony (FDM), crossbar switches, long-haul coaxial/radio
- 1960sâ€“1980s: Electronic switching systems (ESS), T1/E1 digital trunks, PCM

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- Analog Signal: A continuous electrical waveform representing air pressure (voice).
- Local Loop: The copper pair from subscriber to central office (CO); typically ~600 Î©.
- Transducer Pair: Microphone converts sound to current; earpiece reconverts current to sound.
- Transmission Loss & Impedance: Line length and mismatch cause attenuation and echo.
- Signaling vs. Speech: Supervisory signaling (on/off-hook, ringing) vs. voice band (300â€“3400 Hz).
- Switching: Manual cord boards â†’ electromechanical (Strowger/step-by-step, crossbar).

## How We Got to Analog Telephony
1) Telegraph taught us that information can ride on electricity. But dots/dashes arenâ€™t voice.
2) In telephones, the carbon microphone varies resistance with air pressure, modulating current â€” a true analog of the voice waveform.
3) Long loops lose high frequencies; loading coils and amplifiers extended reach and fidelity.
4) Networks needed switching: first humans (operators), then machines (Strowger/rotary), later crossbar.
5) Multi-channel long distance used frequency-division multiplexing (FDM): many voice channels on one medium.

## Analog Building Blocks Youâ€™ll See Again
- Bandwidth: Voice band standardized ~300â€“3400 Hz â†’ codecs mirror this later in digital.
- Leveling: dBm/dBrn, 600 Î© references â†’ echoes in impedance and hybrid design in VoIP gateways.
- Echo & Delay: 2-wire/4-wire hybrids created echo â€” why echo cancellers exist in IP networks.
- Supervision & Addressing: Loop current, ringing, rotary dial pulses, later DTMF â€” precursors to SIP signaling concepts.

## Mental Model
Think of a phone as an energy translator: sound pressure â†’ current variation â†’ sound pressure again. The networkâ€™s job is to preserve shape and level of that waveform from mouth to ear, while separate mechanisms indicate when to connect/disconnect and where to route.

## Hands-on (10â€“15 min)
1) Draw a subscriber loop: handset, battery, local loop, central office line card, switch.
2) Note where signaling happens (on/off-hook, ringing) versus where speech travels.
3) List two ways analog design constraints still show up in VoIP (e.g., echo canceller, 3.4 kHz band).

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- Why did early phone systems standardize around the 300â€“3400 Hz band?
- What problem do loading coils solve on long copper loops?
- How did switching evolve from manual to automated?

## âœ… Quiz â€” Day 0 (10 Questions + Answers)
1) What does an analog telephone microphone do at the electrical level?
   - Answer: It varies resistance proportional to sound pressure, modulating current.
2) Why were loading coils introduced on copper loops?
   - Answer: To reduce high-frequency attenuation and extend transmission distance/fidelity.
3) Whatâ€™s the difference between speech transmission and supervisory signaling?
   - Answer: Speech carries the voice waveform; supervisory signals indicate loop state and control (on/off-hook, ringing).
4) Which early switching method replaced human operators for most calls?
   - Answer: Electromechanical systems like Strowger (step-by-step) and crossbar.
5) What bandwidth is traditionally allocated to voice, and why?
   - Answer: ~300â€“3400 Hz, balancing intelligibility with line/equipment constraints.
6) What created echo in analog systems that we still mitigate today?
   - Answer: 2-wire/4-wire hybrids and impedance mismatches.
7) What addressing method came before DTMF tones?
   - Answer: Rotary dial pulses.
8) Name one reason the local loop is referenced to ~600 Î©.
   - Answer: It standardizes impedance for matching, measurement, and equipment design.
9) How did analog carrier systems pack multiple calls onto one medium?
   - Answer: Frequency-division multiplexing assigning each call a separate band.
10) What later digital concept directly replaced analog FDM for trunks?
   - Answer: PCM time-division multiplexing (e.g., T1/E1).
