# Day 0 â€” From Fire Signals to Analog Telephony

## Objectives
- Trace the evolution of communications from ancient signaling to analog telephony
- Understand how physics and engineering constraints shaped early telephone systems
- Learn the core analog concepts that lead into digital telephony (Day 2)

## Why Day 0?
Before PBXs and SIP, people still needed to communicate at a distance. Knowing how we got to analog telephony gives you the intuition for why telephony systems look the way they do today.

## A Fast Timeline
- Prehistory â†’ 19th c.: Beacons, drums, optical semaphores, electric telegraph (Morse, 1830s)
- 1876: Bellâ€™s telephone patXent â€” transmit voice as a varying electrical signal
 - 1876: Bellâ€™s telephone patent â€” transmit voice as a varying electrical signal
- 1880sâ€“1900s: Manual switchboards, local loops, magneto telephones
- 1910sâ€“1930s: Common-battery systems, loaded lines, vacuum-tube amplifiers
- 1930sâ€“1960s: Carrier telephony (FDM), crossbar switches, long-haul coaxial/radio
- 1960sâ€“1980s: Electronic switching systems (ESS), T1/E1 digital trunks, PCM

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- Analog Signal: A continuous electrical waveform representing air pressure (voice).
- Local Loop: The copper pair from subscriber to central office (CO); typically ~600 Î©.
- Transducer Pair: Microphone converts sound to current; earpiece reconverts current to sound.
- Transmission Loss & Impedance: Line length and mismatch cause attenuation and echo.
- Signaling vs. Speech: Supervisory signaling (on/off-hook, ringing) vs. voice band (300â€“3400 Hz).
- Switching: Manual cord boards â†’ electromechanical (Strowger/step-by-step, crossbar).

## Bellâ€™s 1876 Patent â€” What it actually claims (plain English)

TL;DR: Bell formalizes sending continuous, wave-like ("undulatory") electrical signals that mirror sound waves, and shows a practical transmitter/receiver so speech can ride those waves. This is the core leap from on/off telegraph pulses to the telephone.

### Core ideas
- Undulatory vs. intermittent currents: Instead of on/off telegraph pulses, Bell uses smooth electrical variations that map to sound pressure (a sinusoid analogy).
- How to make them: Vibrate a magnet near a coil, or vibrate a membrane (diaphragm) linked to an armature in front of an electromagnetâ€”voice in â†’ matching electrical undulations out.
- How to detect them: A tuned receiverâ€™s armature vibrates in sympathy, recreating the sound.
- Multiple notes/signals at once: Different pitches superpose without collapsing into a "continuous" DC levelâ€”key insight for multiplexing concepts.

### The five claims (simplified)
1. Use undulatory currents to vibrate a receiver for telegraphy (foundation for voice telegraphy).
2. Combine a vibrating magnetic element (or any inductive body) with a closed circuit so its motion induces electrical undulationsâ€”whether the magnet moves, the conductor moves, or both.
3. Produce undulations in a continuous current by moving inductive bodies (or the conductor) near each other.
4. Also produce undulations by varying resistance or battery power gradually (not breaking the circuit).
5. Transmit vocal (or other) sounds by creating electrical undulations that are similar in form to the air vibrations of those soundsâ€”i.e., speech-grade transmission.

### Why it matters to our PBX/VoIP course
- Day 1 (Big Picture): Bellâ€™s "undulations" = the first analog of todayâ€™s digitized RTP media streamâ€”the idea that signal shape encodes sound is the through-line from 1876 to IP telephony.
- Day 2 (Analogâ†’Digital): Bellâ€™s continuous currents are the analog side we later sample/quantize (e.g., G.711) before shipping over packet networks.
- Day 4 (SIP signaling): Bellâ€™s patent is about media, not call setup. Modern SIP sets up sessions; RTP carries the (now digital) "undulations."
- Day 3 (Codecs/RTP): Where Bell had a vibrating armature and membrane, we use codecs (Opus, G.711) and RTP timestamps/sequence to reconstruct voice.

## How We Got to Analog Telephony
1) Telegraph taught us that information can ride on electricity. But dots/dashes arenâ€™t voice.
2) In telephones, the carbon microphone varies resistance with air pressure, modulating current â€” a true analog of the voice waveform.
3) Long loops lose high frequencies; loading coils and amplifiers extended reach and fidelity.
4) Networks needed switching: first humans (operators), then machines (Strowger/rotary), later crossbar.
5) Multi-channel long distance used frequency-division multiplexing (FDM): many voice channels on one medium.

## Analog Building Blocks Youâ€™ll See Again
- Bandwidth: Voice band standardized ~300â€“3400 Hz â†’ codecs mirror this later in digital.
- Leveling: dBm/dBrn, 600 Î© references â†’ echoes in impedance and hybrid design in VoIP gateways.
- Echo & Delay: 2-wire/4-wire hybrids created echo â€” why echo cancellers exist in IP networks.
- Supervision & Addressing: Loop current, ringing, rotary dial pulses, later DTMF â€” precursors to SIP signaling concepts.

## Mental Model
Think of a phone as an energy translator: sound pressure â†’ current variation â†’ sound pressure again. The networkâ€™s job is to preserve shape and level of that waveform from mouth to ear, while separate mechanisms indicate when to connect/disconnect and where to route.

## Hands-on (10â€“15 min)
1) Draw a subscriber loop: handset, battery, local loop, central office line card, switch.
2) Note where signaling happens (on/off-hook, ringing) versus where speech travels.
3) List two ways analog design constraints still show up in VoIP (e.g., echo canceller, 3.4 kHz band).

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- Why did early phone systems standardize around the 300â€“3400 Hz band?
- What problem do loading coils solve on long copper loops?
- How did switching evolve from manual to automated?

## Appendix â€” Deep Dives

### Deep Dive: Local Loop Impedance, Hybrids, and Echo

- Why it matters: The classic ~600 Î© reference and 2-wire/4-wire hybrids shaped analog design and still influence gateways and echo cancellers today.
- Key details:
  - Impedance mismatches cause reflections â†’ audible echo; hybrids convert 2-wire subscriber loops to separate send/receive paths.
  - Echo cancellers in modern IP gear model hybrid leakage; long one-way delays make echo more noticeable [ITUâ€‘T G.168].
  - Voiceband standardization (~300â€“3400 Hz) informed later PCM sampling (8 kHz) [ITUâ€‘T G.711].
- Practical checklist:
  - When using ATAs/gateways, match impedance/regional settings; enable echo cancellation; verify levels.

### Deep Dive: Loading Coils and Line Equalization

- Why it matters: Loading coils extended analog reach by improving highâ€‘frequency response on long copper pairs.
- Key details:
  - Series inductance reduces attenuation and flattens the passband over voice frequencies on long loops.
  - Incompatible with broadband (xDSL) and must be removed for modern services.
  - Historic techniques informed later equalization/compensation designs.
- Practical example:
  - Long rural loops with audible highâ€‘frequency rollâ€‘off improved after removing legacy loading before VoIP migration.

### Deep Dive: From FDM Carrier to PCM (T1/E1)

- Why it matters: Understanding FDM explains how many analog calls shared a medium and why digital PCM (T1/E1) replaced it.
- Key details:
  - Analog carrier systems stacked channels in frequency bands (FDM) over coax/radio.
  - PCM digitizes voice at 8 kHz with 8â€‘bit samples â†’ 64 kbps per channel (G.711), multiplexed into T1/E1 frames.
  - Digital trunks simplified regeneration, switching, and noise accumulation.
- Practical checklist:
  - When migrating legacy sites, map FDM-era concepts to digital/VoIP capacity planning (channels â†” sessions).
