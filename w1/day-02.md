# Day 2 ‚Äî Telephony 101: From Analog to Digital

## Objectives
- Understand analog vs digital lines and signaling
- Learn FXS/FXO, T1/E1, and trunking
- Distinguish call setup from media transport

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- FXS (Foreign eXchange Station): Port that delivers analog line to a phone (provides battery and dial tone).
- FXO (Foreign eXchange Office): Port that connects a device to the PSTN or FXS port (receives battery and dial tone).
- T1/E1 (Digital trunks): Bundles of digital channels (T1=24 ch in NA; E1=32 ch in EU), used before SIP trunks became common.
- Trunk: A high-capacity link carrying multiple calls between systems.
- Call setup vs transport: Setup is signaling (e.g., SIP/ISDN); transport is voice frames (e.g., RTP/TDM).

## Details: FXS/FXO, PRI (T1/E1), and Analog‚ÜîIP Gateways

### FXS vs FXO (Analog Interfaces)
- What it is and why it matters: FXS provides battery and dial tone to analog phones; FXO receives that service to connect devices toward the PSTN. Choosing the correct side avoids wiring errors and no-dial-tone issues.
- Key details:
  - FXS ‚Üí Phone/ATA; FXO ‚Üí PSTN/FXS.
  - Ring voltage, polarity, and impedance vary by region; verify device specs.
  - Caller ID delivery methods (FSK/DTMF) and timing differ by country; align with gateways.
- Checklist: Identify the power-supplying side; match regional signaling; test ring cadence and caller ID.

### PRI over T1/E1
- What it is and why it matters: PRI provided multi-channel digital trunks before SIP became ubiquitous. Understanding channelization and signaling helps with legacy migrations and troubleshooting.
- Key details:
  - T1 PRI: 23B+1D (24 timeslots); E1 PRI: 30B+1D+1 framing slot (32 timeslots).
  - Signaling: ISDN Q.931 on the D-channel; framing/line defined by G.704/G.703 (E1).
  - Common gotchas: CRC/framing mismatches, clock slips, and profile differences (NI2 vs EuroISDN).
- Checklist: Confirm framing/CRC/clocking, switch type, and channel map; test inbound/outbound call setup.

### Analog‚ÜîIP Gateways (ATAs and Media Gateways)
- What it is and why it matters: Gateways and ATAs bridge legacy analog phones/faxes, door phones, and alarms into IP PBXs. They enable phased migrations and preserve critical analog endpoints.
- Key details:
  - ATA ports are FXS (to analog device); upstream SIP to PBX/ITSP.
  - Fax: prefer T.38 when supported; otherwise G.711 pass-through with careful jitter/ptime.
  - Dial-plan nuances: hook-flash, pulse-to-tone conversion, and caller ID timing.
- Checklist: Map ports to extensions/DIDs; set codec policy (G.711 for fax); test hook-flash features and failover.

## Appendix ‚Äî Deep Dives

### Deep Dive: PRI Signaling and Framing (Q.931, G.704)

- Why it matters: Correct framing and signaling are essential for stable T1/E1 PRI links during migrations.
- Key details:
  - D‚Äëchannel carries Q.931 call control (SETUP/CONNECT/RELEASE) for channel allocation.
  - T1: 23B+1D; E1: 30B+1D(+1 framing). Framing/CRC/clocking must match the telco [ITU‚ÄëT G.704/G.703].
  - Common issues: slips, CRC errors, NI2 vs EuroISDN profile mismatches.
- Practical checklist:
  - Verify line coding, framing, CRC, and switch type; monitor alarms/slips; confirm channel maps.
- References: [ITU‚ÄëT Q.931](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.931), [ITU‚ÄëT G.704](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.704), [ITU‚ÄëT G.703](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.703)

### Deep Dive: Fax over IP ‚Äî T.38 vs G.711 Pass‚ÄëThrough

- Why it matters: Fax reliability depends on choosing the right transport over lossy IP links.
- Key details:
  - T.38 relays fax data, avoiding PCM impairments; requires endpoint/gateway support [ITU‚ÄëT T.38].
  - G.711 pass‚Äëthrough can work on clean networks; sensitive to jitter/loss/ptime choices.
  - Interop: negotiate per call; some gateways can switch to T.38 mid‚Äëcall on CED/ANS detection.
- Practical checklist:
  - Prefer T.38 when available; otherwise use G.711 ¬µ/A‚Äëlaw, stable jitter buffers, 20 ms `ptime`.
- References: [ITU‚ÄëT T.38](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.38/en), [Asterisk T.38 Gateway](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/T.38+Gateway)

### Deep Dive: Analog Caller ID Signaling (FSK vs DTMF)

- Why it matters: CID delivery differences impact ATAs/gateway configs across regions.
- Key details:
  - Many regions use Bellcore/ETSI FSK between first/second ring; others use DTMF post‚Äëring.
  - Timing/leveling and polarity can affect decode success; configure per locale.
  - Gateway features may include polarity reversal and ring cadence control.
- Practical checklist:
  - Set country profile on ATAs; test CID with local carriers and adjust timing.
