# Day 3 ‚Äî VoIP Basics: Codecs, Packets & Media

## Objectives
- Learn how voice is digitized and transmitted
- Understand RTP/RTCP and codec negotiation
- Recognize jitter, latency, and packet loss impacts

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- Codec: Algorithm that compresses audio. Common: G.711 (64 kbps, uncompressed), Opus (adaptive, modern), G.729 (compressed, licensed in some regions).
- RTP: Carries audio packets (media stream) with sequence numbers and timestamps.
- RTCP: Companion control protocol that reports quality (jitter, loss, round-trip time).
- Jitter buffer: Smooths packet timing variation; too small leads to choppiness, too big adds delay.

## Call Flow Snapshot
1) Endpoints negotiate codecs in SIP (offer/answer, SDP)
2) Media flows directly between endpoints (or via PBX/SBC) over RTP/UDP
3) RTCP reports help diagnose quality issues

## Practical Bitrates (rule of thumb)
- G.711: ~87 kbps per direction including IP/UDP/RTP overhead
- G.729: ~31‚Äì40 kbps per direction depending on packetization
- Opus: Variable (6‚Äì40+ kbps), resilient to loss

## Hands-on: Capture RTP (15‚Äì20 min)
1) Start Wireshark. Filter: `sip || rtp || rtcp`
2) Make/receive a VoIP call (softphone to softphone or lab capture file)
3) Use Telephony ‚Üí RTP ‚Üí Streams ‚Üí Analyze to inspect jitter and loss
4) Export audio and play it back to verify media path

## Troubleshooting Hints
- One-way audio: Usually NAT/firewall or wrong SDP address/port
- No audio: Codec mismatch or blocked UDP
- Choppy audio: Jitter buffer too small or network congestion

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- What carries media: SIP or RTP?
- Which protocol reports quality metrics?
- Why might Opus survive poor Wi-Fi better than G.711?

- File: `day3_rtp_analysis.png` (RTP Streams analysis screenshot); optional: `day3_call_capture.pcapng`
- Notes: 3‚Äì5 bullets including: chosen codec and packetization (ptime), average jitter/loss from analysis, any RTCP-reported RTT, and whether media was direct or anchored by the PBX/SBC.
- Goal: Validate codec negotiation and assess real call quality with measurable metrics.
