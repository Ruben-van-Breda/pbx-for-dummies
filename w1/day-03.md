# Day 3 ‚Äî VoIP Basics: Codecs, Packets & Media

## Objectives
- Learn how voice is digitized and transmitted
- Understand RTP/RTCP and codec negotiation
- Recognize jitter, latency, and packet loss impacts

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- Codec: Algorithm that compresses audio. Common: G.711 (64 kbps, uncompressed), Opus (adaptive, modern), G.729 (compressed, licensed in some regions).
- RTP: Carries audio packets (media stream) with sequence numbers and timestamps.
- RTCP: Companion control protocol that reports quality (jitter, loss, round-trip time).
- Jitter buffer: Smooths packet timing variation; too small leads to choppiness, too big adds delay.

## Call Flow Snapshot
1) Endpoints negotiate codecs in SIP (offer/answer, SDP)
2) Media flows directly between endpoints (or via PBX/SBC) over RTP/UDP
3) RTCP reports help diagnose quality issues

## Practical Bitrates (rule of thumb)
- G.711: ~87 kbps per direction including IP/UDP/RTP overhead
- G.729: ~31‚Äì40 kbps per direction depending on packetization
- Opus: Variable (6‚Äì40+ kbps), resilient to loss

## Hands-on: Capture RTP (15‚Äì20 min)
1) Start Wireshark. Filter: `sip || rtp || rtcp`
2) Make/receive a VoIP call (softphone to softphone or lab capture file)
3) Use Telephony ‚Üí RTP ‚Üí Streams ‚Üí Analyze to inspect jitter and loss
4) Export audio and play it back to verify media path

## Troubleshooting Hints
- One-way audio: Usually NAT/firewall or wrong SDP address/port
- No audio: Codec mismatch or blocked UDP
- Choppy audio: Jitter buffer too small or network congestion

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- What carries media: SIP or RTP?
- Which protocol reports quality metrics?
- Why might Opus survive poor Wi-Fi better than G.711?

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 3 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What does a codec do in VoIP?
   - Answer: Compresses/encodes audio for transmission (and decodes on receive).

2) Name one uncompressed and one modern adaptive codec from the lesson.
   - Answer: G.711 (uncompressed), Opus (adaptive).

3) Which protocol carries the media stream and which reports quality?
   - Answer: RTP carries media; RTCP reports quality (jitter, loss, RTT).

4) What is the purpose of a jitter buffer?
   - Answer: Smooth variation in packet arrival times; avoid choppiness vs added delay.

5) Roughly how much bandwidth does G.711 use per direction including overhead?
   - Answer: ~87 kbps per direction.

6) In SIP, where is codec negotiation performed?
   - Answer: In the SDP offer/answer exchange.

7) A call has one-way audio. What are two common causes?
   - Answer: NAT/firewall issues or wrong SDP address/port.

8) What Wireshark filter would you use to view both signaling and media?
   - Answer: `sip || rtp || rtcp`.

9) Why might Opus survive poor Wi‚ÄëFi better than G.711?
   - Answer: Opus adapts bitrate/robustness and tolerates loss better.

10) If packetization increases (larger ptime), what's a tradeoff?
   - Answer: Fewer packets (lower overhead) but more latency and loss impact per packet.

## Appendix ‚Äî Deep Dives

### Deep Dive: SDP Offer/Answer and Packetization (ptime)

- Why it matters: Codec choice and packetization directly affect bandwidth, latency, and loss impact. SIP endpoints negotiate these via SDP during offer/answer.
- Key details:
  - Offer/answer defines how endpoints agree on media parameters and codecs [RFC 3264 ‚Äî Offer/Answer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3264).
  - SDP syntax and attributes (including `a=ptime` and `a=maxptime`) are specified in the current SDP spec [RFC 8866 ‚Äî SDP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8866).
  - `ptime` indicates the preferred packetization time in milliseconds per audio packet; common values: 20 ms (G.711 default), 10‚Äì60 ms typical ranges. `maxptime` bounds the maximum.
  - Endpoints may advertise preferences but can transmit different packetization if needed; interoperability improves when both sides support 20 ms.
  - Tradeoffs: larger `ptime` lowers packets/second and overhead but adds mouth-to-ear delay and increases loss impact per packet.
- Practical example:

```sdp
v=0
o=- 0 0 IN IP4 203.0.113.10
s=Call
c=IN IP4 203.0.113.10
t=0 0
m=audio 40000 RTP/AVP 0 8 101
a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000
a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000
a=fmtp:101 0-16
a=ptime:20
a=maxptime:40
```

### Deep Dive: RTCP Reports and Jitter Interpretation

- Why it matters: RTCP sender/receiver reports quantify quality (loss, jitter, RTT) and help pinpoint impairments.
- Key details:
  - RTP defines interarrival jitter and RTCP report blocks with fraction lost, cumulative lost, highest seq, jitter, and LSR/DLSR for RTT [RFC 3550 ‚Äî RTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550).
  - Jitter is a smoothed estimator (per-packet transit variance); values are in timestamp units. Tools convert to milliseconds using the payload clock rate.
  - RTT is derived from sender/receiver report timestamps: `RTT ‚âà now - LSR - DLSR` per [RFC 3550 ‚Äî RTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550).
  - Reasonable targets: low single-digit ms jitter on wired LANs; higher on Wi‚ÄëFi. One‚Äëway delay budgets above ~150 ms start to be noticeable [ITU‚ÄëT G.114](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.114/en).
  - Loss patterns matter: bursty loss degrades voice more than the same average random loss.
- Practical checklist:
  - In Wireshark: Telephony ‚Üí RTP ‚Üí Streams ‚Üí Analyze to view jitter, loss, and clock skew; correlate with RTCP [Wireshark RTP Analysis](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChTelRTP.html).
  - Compare uplink vs downlink metrics; asymmetry often indicates access-network problems.
  - Validate that SSRCs and payload types match negotiated SDP.

### Deep Dive: Opus over RTP (Payload, FEC, and Packetization)

- Why it matters: Opus is a modern, adaptive codec that delivers high quality across diverse networks when configured correctly.
- Key details:
  - RTP payload format for Opus, including clock rate (48000 Hz) and channel parameters, is defined in [RFC 7587 ‚Äî RTP Payload for Opus](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7587).
  - Typical SDP advertises `rtpmap` and optional `fmtp` parameters such as `minptime`, `maxptime`, `stereo`, `sprop-maxcapturerate`, and `useinbandfec`.
  - In-band FEC (`useinbandfec=1`) improves robustness to burst loss; consider enabling on lossy links in combination with smaller `ptime` (e.g., 20 ms).
  - DTX can reduce bandwidth during silence but may interact with VAD/comfort-noise; test end-to-end behavior.
  - Interop notes: ensure both sides agree on stereo vs mono and honor `maxptime` ‚â§ 60 ms as commonly implemented.
- Example SDP offer snippet:

```sdp
m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 111 101
a=rtpmap:111 opus/48000/2
a=fmtp:111 minptime=10;maxptime=60;useinbandfec=1
a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000
```
