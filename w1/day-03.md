# Day 3 ‚Äî VoIP Basics: Codecs, Packets & Media

## Objectives
- Learn how voice is digitized and transmitted
- Understand RTP/RTCP and codec negotiation
- Recognize jitter, latency, and packet loss impacts

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- Codec: Algorithm that compresses audio. Common: G.711 (64 kbps, uncompressed), Opus (adaptive, modern), G.729 (compressed, licensed in some regions).
- RTP: Carries audio packets (media stream) with sequence numbers and timestamps.
- RTCP: Companion control protocol that reports quality (jitter, loss, round-trip time).
- Jitter buffer: Smooths packet timing variation; too small leads to choppiness, too big adds delay.

## Call Flow Snapshot
1) Endpoints negotiate codecs in SIP (offer/answer, SDP)
2) Media flows directly between endpoints (or via PBX/SBC) over RTP/UDP
3) RTCP reports help diagnose quality issues

## Practical Bitrates (rule of thumb)
- G.711: ~87 kbps per direction including IP/UDP/RTP overhead
- G.729: ~31‚Äì40 kbps per direction depending on packetization
- Opus: Variable (6‚Äì40+ kbps), resilient to loss

## Hands-on: Capture RTP (15‚Äì20 min)
1) Start Wireshark. Filter: `sip || rtp || rtcp`
2) Make/receive a VoIP call (softphone to softphone or lab capture file)
3) Use Telephony ‚Üí RTP ‚Üí Streams ‚Üí Analyze to inspect jitter and loss
4) Export audio and play it back to verify media path

## Troubleshooting Hints
- One-way audio: Usually NAT/firewall or wrong SDP address/port
- No audio: Codec mismatch or blocked UDP
- Choppy audio: Jitter buffer too small or network congestion

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- What carries media: SIP or RTP?
- Which protocol reports quality metrics?
- Why might Opus survive poor Wi-Fi better than G.711?

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 3 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What does a codec do in VoIP?
   - Answer: Compresses/encodes audio for transmission (and decodes on receive).

2) Name one uncompressed and one modern adaptive codec from the lesson.
   - Answer: G.711 (uncompressed), Opus (adaptive).

3) Which protocol carries the media stream and which reports quality?
   - Answer: RTP carries media; RTCP reports quality (jitter, loss, RTT).

4) What is the purpose of a jitter buffer?
   - Answer: Smooth variation in packet arrival times; avoid choppiness vs added delay.

5) Roughly how much bandwidth does G.711 use per direction including overhead?
   - Answer: ~87 kbps per direction.

6) In SIP, where is codec negotiation performed?
   - Answer: In the SDP offer/answer exchange.

7) A call has one-way audio. What are two common causes?
   - Answer: NAT/firewall issues or wrong SDP address/port.

8) What Wireshark filter would you use to view both signaling and media?
   - Answer: `sip || rtp || rtcp`.

9) Why might Opus survive poor Wi‚ÄëFi better than G.711?
   - Answer: Opus adapts bitrate/robustness and tolerates loss better.

10) If packetization increases (larger ptime), what's a tradeoff?
   - Answer: Fewer packets (lower overhead) but more latency and loss impact per packet.
