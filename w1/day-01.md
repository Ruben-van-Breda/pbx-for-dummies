# Day 1 ‚Äî The Big Picture: What is a PBX?

## Objectives
- Understand the role of a PBX in telephony systems
- Differentiate PSTN, PBX, and IP-PBX
- See how VoIP disrupted traditional PBXs

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- PBX (Private Branch Exchange): The private phone system inside an organization. Routes internal calls and connects to external networks.
- PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network): The global, circuit-switched telephone network.
- IP-PBX: A PBX implemented in software that uses IP networking (e.g., Asterisk, FreeSWITCH).
- SIP: Signaling protocol used to set up, modify, and tear down calls in IP telephony.

## Mental Model
A PBX is like your company‚Äôs internal air traffic control for calls. It knows who is calling, where to route the call, how to handle external lines, and how to apply features (voicemail, IVR, queues).

```

              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ Internal extensions, voicemail, IVR, queues
```

## What VoIP Changed
- Switched from proprietary hardware to software running on commodity servers
- Reduced cost and increased flexibility (APIs, integrations, remote work)
- Enabled cloud telephony: UCaaS/CPaaS providers abstract carrier complexity

## Hands-on (10‚Äì15 min)
1) Sketch a basic PBX topology that includes:
   - Two internal extensions (e.g., 1000, 1001)
   - The PBX
   - A SIP trunk to a carrier
   - An external destination on the PSTN
2) Write 3 bullets on when a PBX uses the SIP trunk vs an internal route.

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- When do you need a SIP trunk?
- What‚Äôs the difference between PBX and IP-PBX?
- Which protocol sets up calls in VoIP?

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 1 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What does PBX stand for, and what is its primary role?
   - Answer: Private Branch Exchange; it routes internal calls and connects to external networks.

2) Which global network do traditional phone calls traverse outside an organization?
   - Answer: The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

3) What is an IP-PBX, and how does it differ from a traditional PBX?
   - Answer: A software-based PBX that runs over IP networks; unlike traditional hardware PBXs, it uses standard servers and IP signaling/media.

4) Which signaling protocol is commonly used to set up, modify, and tear down VoIP calls?
   - Answer: SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).

5) In the mental model diagram, when would a call go from the PBX to the SIP trunk rather than stay internal?
   - Answer: When the destination is outside the organization (e.g., to the PSTN/external numbers).

6) Name two ways VoIP disrupted traditional PBXs.
   - Answer: Shifted from proprietary hardware to software on commodity servers; reduced costs and enabled flexible integrations/APIs and remote work.

7) What do UCaaS/CPaaS providers abstract for customers in cloud telephony?
   - Answer: Carrier complexity (e.g., trunks, scaling, routing, compliance) via cloud services and APIs.

8) Give two typical internal PBX features mentioned in Day 1.
   - Answer: Voicemail and IVR (also queues).

9) In a basic PBX topology, list four components you should include.
   - Answer: Two internal extensions (e.g., 1000, 1001), the PBX, a SIP trunk to a carrier, and an external PSTN destination.

10) Why is SIP specifically called a signaling protocol in VoIP?
   - Answer: Because it handles call setup/teardown and session control, not the actual media (which is typically carried via RTP).
