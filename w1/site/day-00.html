      <h1>Day 0 ‚Äî From Fire Signals to Analog Telephony</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="content">
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Trace the evolution of communications from ancient signaling to analog telephony</li>
        <li>Understand how physics and engineering constraints shaped early telephone systems</li>
        <li>Learn the core analog concepts that lead into digital telephony (Day 2)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Day 0?</h2>
      <p>Before PBXs and SIP, people still needed to communicate at a distance. Knowing how we got to analog telephony gives you the intuition for why telephony systems look the way they do today.</p>

      <h2>A Fast Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prehistory ‚Üí 19th c.: Beacons, drums, optical semaphores, electric telegraph (Morse, 1830s)</li>
        <li>1876: Bell‚Äôs telephone patent ‚Äî transmit voice as a varying electrical signal</li>
        <li>1880s‚Äì1900s: Manual switchboards, local loops, magneto telephones</li>
        <li>1910s‚Äì1930s: Common-battery systems, loaded lines, vacuum-tube amplifiers</li>
        <li>1930s‚Äì1960s: Carrier telephony (FDM), crossbar switches, long-haul coaxial/radio</li>
        <li>1960s‚Äì1980s: Electronic switching systems (ESS), T1/E1 digital trunks, PCM</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Concepts (Explained)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analog Signal</strong>: A continuous electrical waveform representing air pressure (voice).</li>
        <li><strong>Local Loop</strong>: The copper pair from subscriber to central office (CO); typically ~600 Œ©.</li>
        <li><strong>Transducer Pair</strong>: Microphone converts sound to current; earpiece reconverts current to sound.</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission Loss &amp; Impedance</strong>: Line length and mismatch cause attenuation and echo.</li>
        <li><strong>Signaling vs. Speech</strong>: Supervisory signaling (on/off-hook, ringing) vs. voice band (300‚Äì3400 Hz).</li>
        <li><strong>Switching</strong>: Manual cord boards ‚Üí electromechanical (Strowger/step-by-step, crossbar).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bell‚Äôs 1876 Patent ‚Äî What it actually claims (plain English)</h2>
      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Bell formalizes sending continuous, wave-like ("undulatory") electrical signals that mirror sound waves, and shows a practical transmitter/receiver so speech can ride those waves. This is the core leap from on/off telegraph pulses to the telephone.</p>

      <h3>Core ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Undulatory vs. intermittent currents</strong>: Instead of on/off telegraph pulses, Bell uses smooth electrical variations that map to sound pressure (a sinusoid analogy).</li>
        <li><strong>How to make them</strong>: Vibrate a magnet near a coil, or vibrate a membrane (diaphragm) linked to an armature in front of an electromagnet‚Äîvoice in ‚Üí matching electrical undulations out.</li>
        <li><strong>How to detect them</strong>: A tuned receiver‚Äôs armature vibrates in sympathy, recreating the sound.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple notes/signals at once</strong>: Different pitches superpose without collapsing into a "continuous" DC level‚Äîkey insight for multiplexing concepts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The five claims (simplified)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Use undulatory currents to vibrate a receiver for telegraphy (foundation for voice telegraphy).</li>
        <li>Combine a vibrating magnetic element (or any inductive body) with a closed circuit so its motion induces electrical undulations‚Äîwhether the magnet moves, the conductor moves, or both.</li>
        <li>Produce undulations in a continuous current by moving inductive bodies (or the conductor) near each other.</li>
        <li>Also produce undulations by varying resistance or battery power gradually (not breaking the circuit).</li>
        <li>Transmit vocal (or other) sounds by creating electrical undulations that are similar in form to the air vibrations of those sounds‚Äîi.e., speech-grade transmission.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Why it matters to our PBX/VoIP course</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 1 (Big Picture)</strong>: Bell‚Äôs "undulations" = the first analog of today‚Äôs digitized RTP media stream‚Äîthe idea that signal shape encodes sound is the through-line from 1876 to IP telephony.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 2 (Analog‚ÜíDigital)</strong>: Bell‚Äôs continuous currents are the analog side we later sample/quantize (e.g., G.711) before shipping over packet networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 4 (SIP signaling)</strong>: Bell‚Äôs patent is about media, not call setup. Modern SIP sets up sessions; RTP carries the (now digital) "undulations."</li>
        <li><strong>Day 3 (Codecs/RTP)</strong>: Where Bell had a vibrating armature and membrane, we use codecs (Opus, G.711) and RTP timestamps/sequence to reconstruct voice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hands-on (10‚Äì15 min)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Draw a subscriber loop: handset, battery, local loop, central office line card, switch.</li>
        <li>Note where signaling happens (on/off-hook, ringing) versus where speech travels.</li>
        <li>List two ways analog design constraints still show up in VoIP (e.g., echo canceller, 3.4 kHz band).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quick Check (Self-test)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Why did early phone systems standardize around the 300‚Äì3400 Hz band?</li>
        <li>What problem do loading coils solve on long copper loops?</li>
        <li>How did switching evolve from manual to automated?</li>
      </ul>
