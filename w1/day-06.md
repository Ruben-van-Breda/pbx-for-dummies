# Day 6 ‚Äî Common PBX Platforms

## Objectives
- Compare Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, 3CX, and cloud PBXs
- Learn open-source vs commercial models

## Comparison Snapshot
- Asterisk: Mature, huge ecosystem, dialplan-centric, flexible modules (PJSIP, ARI, AMI)
- FreeSWITCH: Media powerhouse, XML dialplan, strong conferencing features
- 3CX: Commercial, Windows/Linux, GUI-driven, integrated features out of the box
- Cloud PBX (UCaaS/CPaaS): Twilio, Plivo, etc. API-first, pay-as-you-go, rapid integration

## Selection Criteria
- Feature needs (queues, recording, IVR complexity)
- Scale and stability requirements
- Integration surface (REST/Webhooks/Streaming APIs)
- Ops model (self-managed vs managed cloud)

## Hands-on (10‚Äì15 min)
1) Skim the feature pages of Asterisk and FreeSWITCH
2) List 3 reasons to choose each for a small team vs a call center

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- Which platform is most API-driven out-of-the-box?
- When would you prefer a self-hosted PBX over UCaaS?
