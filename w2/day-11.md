# Day 11 ‚Äî Security & SBCs

## Objectives
- Secure SIP with TLS and media with SRTP (lab)
- Understand Session Border Controllers (SBCs)

## Concepts (Explained)
- TLS for SIP: Encrypts signaling; requires certificates and `transport=tls`
- SRTP: Encrypts media; negotiated via SDP (e.g., `a=crypto` or DTLS-SRTP)
- SBC: B2BUA focused on security, topology hiding, NAT traversal, QoS, and policy enforcement

## Lab (20‚Äì30 min)
1) Generate self-signed certs (lab only)
2) Enable TLS transport in `pjsip.conf`:
```
[transport-tls]
type=transport
protocol=tls
bind=0.0.0.0:5061
method=tlsv1_2
cert_file=/etc/asterisk/keys/asterisk.pem
priv_key_file=/etc/asterisk/keys/asterisk.key
```
3) Allow SRTP on endpoints:
```
media_encryption=sdes
```
4) Configure softphones to use TLS/SRTP
5) Verify in CLI and Wireshark (no plain SIP; RTP not decodable)

## Notes
- In production prefer proper PKI and possibly DTLS-SRTP
- Consider an SBC for internet-facing trunks and remote users

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- Why doesn‚Äôt TLS alone secure audio?
- What benefits does an SBC add beyond TLS/SRTP?

## Common Pitfalls
- Certificate issues: Wrong CN/SAN or expired cert ‚Üí softphones reject TLS; match FQDN and time-sync servers.
- TLS versions/ciphers: Client requires TLS 1.2/1.3; align method/cipher suites on both ends.
- SIPS vs SIP over TLS: Some clients expect `sips:` scheme; ensure transport and URIs match.
- SRTP mode mismatch: Endpoint uses DTLS-SRTP while PBX expects SDES (or vice versa) ‚Üí no media.
- NAT over TLS: 5061 blocked or wrong external address; open firewall and set correct external signaling.
- SBC headers: Topology hiding or header normalization can break auth; whitelist headers and test.

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 11 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What does TLS secure in SIP and what port is commonly used?
   - Answer: Signaling (not media) over TCP; commonly 5061 for TLS.

2) How is media encrypted in VoIP?
   - Answer: SRTP (often negotiated via SDES or DTLS-SRTP in SDP).

3) Name two roles of an SBC.
   - Answer: Topology hiding/NAT traversal and policy/QoS/security enforcement.

4) Why doesn't TLS alone secure audio?
   - Answer: It encrypts signaling only; media flows over RTP unless SRTP is used.

5) What two files are referenced for TLS keys in the example transport?
   - Answer: `asterisk.pem` (cert) and `asterisk.key` (private key).

6) Which SRTP mode did the example enable on endpoints?
   - Answer: SDES (`media_encryption=sdes`).

7) Give one Wireshark indicator that SRTP is active.
   - Answer: RTP payload not decodable; only packet sizes/timing visible.

8) A softphone rejects TLS due to CN/SAN mismatch. Fix?
   - Answer: Use a cert with correct FQDN in SAN and ensure time sync.

9) What TLS versions are typically required by modern clients?
   - Answer: TLS 1.2 or 1.3.

10) When should you consider an SBC?
   - Answer: For internet-facing trunks/remote users to handle security, NAT, and policy.

## Appendix ‚Äî Deep Dives

### Deep Dive: TLS Ciphers, Versions, and Certificate Hygiene

- What it is and why it matters: Correct TLS versions/ciphers and valid certificates prevent handshake failures and MITM risks.
- Key details:
  - Prefer TLS 1.2/1.3; disable outdated versions/ciphers. [RFC 8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446)
  - Certificates must include correct SANs (FQDN) and valid chains; clients validate hostname.
  - Align client/server cipher suites; test with `openssl s_client`.
- Practical checklist:
  - Use modern cipher suites; renew certs before expiry; sync time (NTP).
  - Verify CN/SAN match and intermediate chain on the server.
- References: [RFC 8446 ‚Äî TLS 1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446), [Asterisk Secure Calling](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Secure+Calling)

### Deep Dive: SRTP Keying ‚Äî SDES vs DTLS‚ÄëSRTP

- What it is and why it matters: SRTP protects media; key exchange method impacts security and interoperability.
- Key details:
  - SDES: Keys signaled in SDP (`a=crypto`); simpler but exposes keys to signaling path.
  - DTLS‚ÄëSRTP: Keys negotiated over DTLS; preferred in WebRTC and modern endpoints. [RFC 5764](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5764)
  - Interop: Ensure both ends support the same mode; otherwise expect no media.
- Practical checklist:
  - Prefer DTLS‚ÄëSRTP where possible; fall back to SDES for legacy.
  - Confirm cipher suites (AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80) and rekey behavior.
- References: [RFC 3711 ‚Äî SRTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3711), [RFC 5764 ‚Äî DTLS‚ÄëSRTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5764)

### Deep Dive: SBC Capabilities and Topology Hiding

- What it is and why it matters: SBCs act as B2BUAs that enforce security policies, normalize signaling, and hide internal topology.
- Key details:
  - Header manipulation: remove private IPs, normalize `Via`/`Contact`, enforce auth.
  - Media anchoring: centralize RTP, enable transcoding and QoS; simplifies NAT traversal.
  - Policy and DoS controls: rate limiting, access lists, TLS termination.
- Practical checklist:
  - Place SBC at the edge; define ingress/egress policies; log SIP and media metrics.
  - Test with encrypted and legacy peers; verify failover.
