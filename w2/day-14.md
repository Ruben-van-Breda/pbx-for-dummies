# Day 14 ‚Äî PBX in 2025: Cloud, UCaaS & WebRTC

## Objectives
- Understand modern PBX evolution
- Compare on-prem vs cloud approaches

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- UCaaS: Unified Communications as a Service (hosted PBX + collaboration)
- CPaaS: Communications Platform as a Service (APIs for calls/messaging)
- SBC-aaS: Managed SBC services for secure SIP at the edge
- WebRTC: Browser-native media; integrates with SIP via gateways or SIP over WebSocket

## Integration Patterns
- SIP trunk to UCaaS/CPaaS
- SIP over WebSocket (SIP.js) to PBX/SBC with WSS and ICE
- Media gateways between WebRTC and SIP/RTP

## Hands-on (optional)
- Research how SIP.js registers over WSS and how ICE candidates flow
- Sketch an architecture that connects a browser client to your PBX

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- When would you choose UCaaS vs self-host PBX?
- What role does a WebRTC gateway or SBC play?

## Common Pitfalls
- HTTPS/WSS and certs: Browsers require valid certs for WSS/mic access; self-signed causes failures.
- Permissions/autoplay: Microphone/camera not granted, or autoplay blocked; adjust site permissions.
- ICE servers unreachable: Corporate firewalls block STUN/TURN; provide reachable TURN.
- Codec/gateway mismatch: WebRTC prefers Opus; SIP endpoint may be G.711 ‚Üí plan for transcoding.
- CORS/WebSocket upgrades: WSS blocked or CORS misconfigured; ensure correct origin and proxy rules.

## Industry Example: Siperb ‚Äî WebRTC Softphone + Proxy

Siperb is a modern softphone powered by WebRTC that can work with Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, or any SIP/VoIP PBX. It provides both a browser/mobile/desktop client and a hosted WebRTC-to-SIP proxy that bridges browsers to legacy SIP systems.

- Modes of connectivity (choose per environment):
  - Socket Registration Mode: Client registers directly to your PBX over WSS/SRTP. Push notifications and some proxy features are limited.  
  - Proxy Registration Mode (Passthrough): Device registers to Siperb; you create a ‚Äúconnection‚Äù to your PBX/ITSP. If your side supports ICE + SRTP/DTLS, media can flow directly, minimizing media hops.  
  - Proxy Registration Mode (Transcoding): For legacy PBXs without SRTP/DTLS. Media is transcoded from WebRTC (Opus over DTLS-SRTP) to G.711 RTP.

- Notable features to evaluate:
  - Auto‚Äëprovisioned WebRTC devices (reduced password exposure)
  - Mobile & web push notifications
  - DTLS‚ÜîRTP transcoding options
  - Call recording, transfers, and 3‚Äëway client‚Äëside conferencing

- Where it fits in your architecture:
  - Use as the browser softphone for labs and PoCs
  - Use the proxy when your PBX isn‚Äôt fully WebRTC‚Äëready, or when you want simplified onboarding with provisioning and push
  - Use direct socket registration if you already operate a secure WSS + ICE + TURN stack and want end‚Äëto‚Äëend media without a proxy

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 14 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What is UCaaS?
   - Answer: Unified Communications as a Service ‚Äî hosted PBX + collaboration tools.

2) What is CPaaS?
   - Answer: Communications Platform as a Service ‚Äî APIs for voice/messaging/video.

3) How does WebRTC integrate with SIP systems?
   - Answer: Via gateways or SIP over WebSocket (WSS) and ICE/TURN for media.

4) Why are valid certs required for browser media?
   - Answer: Browsers require HTTPS/WSS and valid certs for mic/camera permissions.

5) What role does an SBC or SBC-aaS play in modern architectures?
   - Answer: Security, NAT traversal, topology hiding, and policy enforcement at the edge.

6) Why plan for transcoding with WebRTC?
   - Answer: WebRTC prefers Opus while SIP endpoints often use G.711.

7) What are typical pitfalls when enabling SIP over WebSocket?
   - Answer: CORS misconfig, WSS upgrade failures, and certificate issues.

8) Why might ICE servers be unreachable in corporate environments?
   - Answer: Firewalls block STUN/TURN; need reachable TURN servers.

## Appendix ‚Äî Deep Dives

### Deep Dive: SIP over WebSocket (WSS) ‚Äî Production Considerations

- What it is and why it matters: WSS enables SIP in browsers; production readiness hinges on TLS, origins, and scaling.
- Key details:
  - Certificates: public CA, correct SANs; browsers reject self‚Äësigned.
  - CORS and origins: restrict to allowed origins; handle WebSocket upgrades at proxy.
  - Keep‚Äëalives: tune ping/pong and server timeouts to avoid drops; support load‚Äëbalancing with sticky sessions.
- Practical checklist:
  - Terminate TLS properly; verify `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` (e.g., `sip`/`sip.js`).
  - Test reconnect/backoff and NAT edge cases.
- References: [SIP.js](https://sipjs.com), [Asterisk & WebRTC](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/WebRTC)

### Deep Dive: WebRTC Media ‚Äî DTLS‚ÄëSRTP, ICE/TURN, and Opus

- What it is and why it matters: Modern browser media stacks require secure transport and NAT traversal to interop with SIP PBXes.
- Key details:
  - DTLS‚ÄëSRTP is mandatory; no `a=crypto` in WebRTC. [RFC 5764](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5764)
  - ICE is required; plan TURN for corporate networks. [RFC 8445](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445)
  - Opus preferred; plan transcoding to G.711 for legacy SIP.
- Practical checklist:
  - Provide working STUN/TURN; validate with Trickle ICE.
  - Confirm DTLS handshake, SRTP keys, and codec negotiation.
- References: [Asterisk WebRTC](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/WebRTC)

### Deep Dive: UCaaS vs CPaaS vs Self‚ÄëHosted ‚Äî Decision Factors

- What it is and why it matters: Picking the right model balances control, time‚Äëto‚Äëvalue, and operating complexity.
- Key details:
  - UCaaS: fastest rollout, managed ops, subscription cost; limited deep customization.
  - CPaaS: API‚Äëdriven; you own logic; variable costs with usage.
  - Self‚Äëhosted: full control; capex/opex for SBCs, security, HA, and compliance.
- Practical checklist:
  - List requirements (compliance, integrations, latency) and map to models.
  - Prototype critical flows (inbound, outbound, WebRTC) before committing.
