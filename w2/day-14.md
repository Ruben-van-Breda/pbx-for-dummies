# Day 14 ‚Äî PBX in 2025: Cloud, UCaaS & WebRTC

## Objectives
- Understand modern PBX evolution
- Compare on-prem vs cloud approaches

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- UCaaS: Unified Communications as a Service (hosted PBX + collaboration)
- CPaaS: Communications Platform as a Service (APIs for calls/messaging)
- SBC-aaS: Managed SBC services for secure SIP at the edge
- WebRTC: Browser-native media; integrates with SIP via gateways or SIP over WebSocket

## Integration Patterns
- SIP trunk to UCaaS/CPaaS
- SIP over WebSocket (SIP.js) to PBX/SBC with WSS and ICE
- Media gateways between WebRTC and SIP/RTP

## Hands-on (optional)
- Research how SIP.js registers over WSS and how ICE candidates flow
- Sketch an architecture that connects a browser client to your PBX

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- When would you choose UCaaS vs self-host PBX?
- What role does a WebRTC gateway or SBC play?

## Common Pitfalls
- HTTPS/WSS and certs: Browsers require valid certs for WSS/mic access; self-signed causes failures.
- Permissions/autoplay: Microphone/camera not granted, or autoplay blocked; adjust site permissions.
- ICE servers unreachable: Corporate firewalls block STUN/TURN; provide reachable TURN.
- Codec/gateway mismatch: WebRTC prefers Opus; SIP endpoint may be G.711 ‚Üí plan for transcoding.
- CORS/WebSocket upgrades: WSS blocked or CORS misconfigured; ensure correct origin and proxy rules.

## Industry Example: Siperb ‚Äî WebRTC Softphone + Proxy

Siperb is a modern softphone powered by WebRTC that can work with Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, or any SIP/VoIP PBX. It provides both a browser/mobile/desktop client and a hosted WebRTC-to-SIP proxy that bridges browsers to legacy SIP systems.

- Modes of connectivity (choose per environment):
  - Socket Registration Mode: Client registers directly to your PBX over WSS/SRTP. Push notifications and some proxy features are limited.  
  - Proxy Registration Mode (Passthrough): Device registers to Siperb; you create a ‚Äúconnection‚Äù to your PBX/ITSP. If your side supports ICE + SRTP/DTLS, media can flow directly, minimizing media hops.  
  - Proxy Registration Mode (Transcoding): For legacy PBXs without SRTP/DTLS. Media is transcoded from WebRTC (Opus over DTLS-SRTP) to G.711 RTP.

- Notable features to evaluate:
  - Auto‚Äëprovisioned WebRTC devices (reduced password exposure)
  - Mobile & web push notifications
  - DTLS‚ÜîRTP transcoding options
  - Call recording, transfers, and 3‚Äëway client‚Äëside conferencing

- Where it fits in your architecture:
  - Use as the browser softphone for labs and PoCs
  - Use the proxy when your PBX isn‚Äôt fully WebRTC‚Äëready, or when you want simplified onboarding with provisioning and push
  - Use direct socket registration if you already operate a secure WSS + ICE + TURN stack and want end‚Äëto‚Äëend media without a proxy

- Notes: How browser connects (WSS), how media is secured (DTLS-SRTP), and where SBC/gateway sits
- Goal: A clear architecture for connecting WebRTC clients to PBX/CPaaS safely.

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 14 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What is UCaaS?
   - Answer: Unified Communications as a Service ‚Äî hosted PBX + collaboration tools.

2) What is CPaaS?
   - Answer: Communications Platform as a Service ‚Äî APIs for voice/messaging/video.

3) How does WebRTC integrate with SIP systems?
   - Answer: Via gateways or SIP over WebSocket (WSS) and ICE/TURN for media.

4) Why are valid certs required for browser media?
   - Answer: Browsers require HTTPS/WSS and valid certs for mic/camera permissions.

5) What role does an SBC or SBC-aaS play in modern architectures?
   - Answer: Security, NAT traversal, topology hiding, and policy enforcement at the edge.

6) Why plan for transcoding with WebRTC?
   - Answer: WebRTC prefers Opus while SIP endpoints often use G.711.

7) What are typical pitfalls when enabling SIP over WebSocket?
   - Answer: CORS misconfig, WSS upgrade failures, and certificate issues.

8) Why might ICE servers be unreachable in corporate environments?
   - Answer: Firewalls block STUN/TURN; need reachable TURN servers.

9) When would you choose UCaaS over self-hosted PBX?
   - Answer: Faster rollout, managed operations, and integrated collaboration features.

10) What should your architecture diagram highlight for WebRTC‚ÜîPBX?
   - Answer: WSS signaling path, ICE/TURN servers, DTLS-SRTP media, and SBC/gateway placement.
