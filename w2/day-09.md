# Day 9 ‚Äî Call Routing & Dialplans

## Objectives
- Write simple inbound/outbound routing rules
- Handle extensions and basic voicemail

## Concepts (Explained)
- Inbound routes: Match DID or trunk, send to IVR/queue/extension
- Outbound routes: Match dial patterns and choose a trunk
- Failover: Try alternate trunks or messages on failure

## Example (Asterisk-style)
```
[from-trunk]
exten => _+1NXXNXXXXXX,1,Goto(inbound,${EXTEN},1)

[inbound]
exten => _+1NXXNXXXXXX,1,Answer()
 same => n,Goto(ivr-main,s,1)

[outbound]
exten => _9NXXNXXXXXX,1,Set(NUM=${EXTEN:1})
 same => n,Dial(PJSIP/trunk_primary/${NUM},30)
 same => n,ExecIf($["${DIALSTATUS}"!="ANSWER"]?Dial(PJSIP/trunk_backup/${NUM},30))
 same => n,Hangup()
```

## Hands-on (15‚Äì20 min)
1) Define an outbound pattern for local calls and block international by default
2) Add an inbound context that sends to IVR (prepared in Day 12)
3) Add simple voicemail for extension 1000 (to be enabled on Day 12)

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- What does `_9NXXNXXXXXX` match?
- Where would you implement least-cost routing?

## Common Pitfalls
- Overlapping/ambiguous patterns: Unexpected matches; prefer specific patterns before broad ones.
- Route loops: Goto between contexts without termination conditions; ensure clear end states.
- Missing normalization: Carriers reject non‚ÄëE.164 numbers; normalize on outbound and map inbound DIDs.
- Emergency/Special numbers: Pattern blocks critical calls; add explicit exceptions and least‚Äërestrictive routes.
- No failover/timeouts: Dial without alternate trunk or timeout ‚Üí long silence for callers; add failbacks.

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 9 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What does the pattern `_9NXXNXXXXXX` match?
   - Answer: 9 followed by a 10-digit NANP number (1 digit N + 2 digit XX + 7 digit XXXXXXX).

2) Where would you implement Least Cost Routing (LCR)?
   - Answer: In outbound dialplan logic choosing among multiple trunks.

3) What‚Äôs a common reason to normalize numbers to E.164?
   - Answer: Provider requirements and consistency across routes and carriers.

4) Give an example failover strategy when a trunk fails.
   - Answer: Attempt trunk_backup if `DIALSTATUS` not `ANSWER` after trunk_primary.

5) Why are overlapping/ambiguous patterns risky?
   - Answer: They cause unexpected matches; specific patterns should precede broader ones.

6) How can you block international calls by default?
   - Answer: Omit matching patterns or explicitly reject, allow only known prefixes.

7) What should inbound routes typically match?
   - Answer: The DID format delivered by the carrier (e.g., E.164) mapped to contexts.

8) Name a place to send inbound calls before an agent.
   - Answer: IVR or queue context.

9) What is a route loop and how to avoid it?
   - Answer: Goto cycles among contexts without termination; ensure end states and conditions.

10) What should you log in a failover test?
   - Answer: Initial route, failure reason/status code, alternate trunk attempt, and final result.
