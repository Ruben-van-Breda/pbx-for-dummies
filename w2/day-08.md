# Day 8 ‚Äî NAT Traversal: STUN, TURN, ICE

## Objectives
- Understand why VoIP fails behind NAT
- Learn how STUN, TURN, and ICE enable media connectivity

## Key Concepts (Explained)
- NAT problem: Private IPs are unroutable from the public internet; SIP/SDP often advertises private addresses.
- STUN: Endpoint discovers its public IP/port mapping.
- TURN: Relays media via a public server when peer-to-peer fails.
- ICE: Gathers candidates (host, reflexive, relayed) and tests paths to choose the best.

## Media Path Logic
1) Offer/answer exchange includes ICE candidates
2) Connectivity checks run in parallel (STUN Binding requests)
3) Best working candidate pair is selected; others pruned

## Hands-on (15‚Äì20 min)
1) Draw a quick diagram of host/reflexive/relayed candidates
2) If available, test a WebRTC call (e.g., `https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/`) and observe candidates
3) Note why PBX/SBCs often anchor media to simplify NAT

## Quick Check (Self-test)
- When is TURN required?
- What does STUN provide that SIP alone does not?
- Why can symmetric NATs be problematic?

## Common Pitfalls
- Missing/invalid STUN or TURN servers: Candidates never gather or fail; verify URLs and credentials.
- Symmetric NAT/firewall: Peer-to-peer fails; expect TURN relay (added latency/cost).
- ICE disabled or no trickle ICE: Slow negotiation or timeouts; enable trickle where possible.
- UDP/RTP ports blocked: SIP works but no audio; open provider RTP ranges and test.
- Wrong public IP in SDP: Use PBX/SBC external address settings or anchor media.

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 8 (10 Questions + Answers)

1) What problem does NAT introduce for VoIP media?
   - Answer: Private IP/ports are not reachable from the internet; SDP often advertises unroutable addresses.

2) What does STUN help an endpoint discover?
   - Answer: Its public IP and port mapping as seen by the STUN server.

3) When is TURN required?
   - Answer: When direct peer-to-peer connectivity fails (e.g., symmetric NAT/firewalls) and media must be relayed.

4) What does ICE do during call setup?
   - Answer: Gathers host/reflexive/relayed candidates and runs connectivity checks to select the best path.

5) Name the three main ICE candidate types.
   - Answer: Host, server-reflexive, and relayed.

6) Why can symmetric NATs be problematic for VoIP?
   - Answer: They map differently per destination, breaking incoming traffic unless relayed via TURN.

7) What is trickle ICE?
   - Answer: Incremental candidate gathering/signaling so checks start before all candidates are known.

8) One-way audio occurs though SIP succeeds. Give two likely causes.
   - Answer: RTP ports blocked by firewall or wrong public IP in SDP.

9) Why do PBX/SBCs often anchor media?
   - Answer: To hide/normalize endpoints behind NAT and ensure stable, routable RTP paths.

10) What tradeoff does TURN introduce?
   - Answer: Higher latency and relay bandwidth cost in exchange for reliable connectivity.

## Appendix ‚Äî Deep Dives

### Deep Dive: ICE Candidate Nomination (Regular vs Aggressive)

- What it is and why it matters: Nomination is how the controlling agent chooses the final working candidate pair for each component. Picking too early can cause sub‚Äëoptimal paths; picking too late can delay media.
- Key details:
  - Regular nomination waits for the highest‚Äëpriority successful check and then marks it with USE‚ÄëCANDIDATE; this is the RECOMMENDED mode for interoperability and with trickle ICE. [RFC 8445 (ICE)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445)
  - Aggressive nomination adds USE‚ÄëCANDIDATE on the first check and can prematurely lock in a non‚Äëoptimal path; avoid when using trickle ICE.
  - Role matters: exactly one side must be controlling. If both believe they are controlling, resolve the role conflict per tie‚Äëbreaker rules before continuing. [RFC 8445 ¬ß6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-6)
  - PBX/SBC note: when interacting with ICE‚Äëlite endpoints, the full agent acts as controlling and performs nomination. [RFC 8445 ¬ß2.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-2.7)
- Practical checklist:
  - Ensure only one controlling agent; watch for role‚Äëconflict errors.
  - Prefer regular nomination; test with trickle and rollback flows.
  - Verify the nominated pair actually carries RTP/RTCP (not just STUN success).

### Deep Dive: TURN Allocations, Permissions, and Channels

- What it is and why it matters: TURN provides a publicly reachable relay address when direct connectivity fails, enabling media to traverse symmetric NATs and strict firewalls.
- Key details:
  - Allocation: client obtains a relayed transport address with a finite lifetime (default 10 minutes) and must refresh periodically. [RFC 5766 ¬ß7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5766#section-7)
  - Permissions: per‚Äëpeer IP allowlists required for UDP data; each permission lasts 300 seconds unless refreshed. [RFC 5766 ¬ß8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5766#section-8)
  - Channels: optional low‚Äëoverhead data path bound to a peer (16‚Äëbit Channel Number); lifetime typically 10 minutes; improves throughput vs Send Indications. [RFC 5766 ¬ß11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5766#section-11)
  - Auth: TURN uses the STUN long‚Äëterm credential mechanism (username/realm/nonce with HMAC‚ÄëSHA1 integrity); servers return 401/438 for auth/nonce issues. [RFC 5389 ¬ß9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5389#section-9), [RFC 5766 ¬ß4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5766#section-4)
  - Transports/ports: UDP/TCP on 3478, TLS on 5349; DTLS and TCP/TLS commonly used for WebRTC. Ensure firewall egress to your TURN and provider IPs. [RFC 5766](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5766)
- Practical checklist:
  - Verify credentials and nonce handling; watch for 401/438 and refresh tokens.
  - Monitor allocation refreshes; expired allocations silently break media.
  - Prefer channels for sustained media; ensure permissions are refreshed every ~4‚Äì5 minutes.

### Deep Dive: ICE Lite vs ICE Full (Servers, PBXs, SBCs)

- What it is and why it matters: ICE‚ÄëLite is a simplified profile intended for servers on public IPs; it reduces complexity by not performing connectivity checks, while remaining interoperable with full ICE peers.
- Key details:
  - ICE‚ÄëLite agents gather only host candidates and do not run connectivity checks; they indicate `ice-lite` in SDP. [RFC 8445 ¬ß2.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-2.7)
  - When talking to ICE‚ÄëLite, the full agent MUST be controlling and performs all checks and nomination. [RFC 8445 ¬ß6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-6.1)
  - Suitable for PBX/SBCs that anchor media on public addresses; not appropriate when the server itself is behind NAT or requires relayed candidates.
  - Interop: still compatible with trickle ICE‚Äîfull agent trickles; lite agent responds.
- Practical checklist:
  - Use ICE‚ÄëLite on publicly reachable media relays/SBCs to simplify NAT.
  - If any side is behind NAT or multi‚Äëhomed with policy routing, prefer full ICE.
  - Always include accurate public addresses in SDP and verify RTCP.

## ‚úÖ Quiz ‚Äî Day 8 (Deep Dives, 10 Questions + Answers)

1) In regular nomination, when is USE‚ÄëCANDIDATE applied?
   - Answer: Only after the highest‚Äëpriority successful check is selected for nomination.
